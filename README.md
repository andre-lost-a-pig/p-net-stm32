# p-net-stm32
In this project, I built p-net in Keil5.
The whole project is based on STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package(https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/tree/v1.10.0). I added some middleware and replaced the project folder.
This project is in Projects\NUCLEO-H723ZG-fatfs-freertos-lwip-osal-pnet-andre. I highly recommend run it using Keil5.
